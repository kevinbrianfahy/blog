  <div class="entry-content"><p>Have an appreciation for the art form!</p>

<p>Some say you can&rsquo;t know where you&rsquo;re going until you know where you came from. Others remind you that understanding the whole helps you become more proficient at your individual part. Others still, would say, respect your elders, and those who came before you.</p>

<p>All in all, I think we do well to realize exactly what&rsquo;s occuring under the hood in order to truly appreciate our work as web developers. Byte&rsquo;s are being transferred, files stored and retrieved, complex electronics coupled with complex programming are occuring in the web sites we develop, and the user interfaces we interact with everyday.</p>

<p>When attending tech conferences that foster the exchange of ideas and communication between different branches of tech, one can really come away with a true appreciation for the work we do in this field, whatever the work may be. Such was the case at the UX conference this past weekend. There was a great array of talent, well developed ideas, and clever presentations over the two day conference here in Madison at our Overture Center. I felt privileged to be there on a free student ticket. I hope with all naiveté, as I move on from this program, into the workforce, that I will desire to pay for that ticket myself, and continue to stay engaged with such conferences. They do great things for the industry.</p>

<p>I could go in depth into the presentations, the study on Generation Z understanding the floppy-disk-save icon, how more people should use svg because it uses math instead of fetching image files from the server, how Frank Lloyed Wright knows what&rsquo;s best for web design, but I think it best to simply say, &ldquo;stay in love with the art form of what you do!&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the best piece of advice, the most timeless wisdom, and one which we constantly have to remind ourselves of everyday.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week was all about completing chapter two. As such, a few things we covered had to be expounded upon in further detail in order to move forward. The charAT vs .length, and how they are used interchangably can be confusing if you don&rsquo;t first have a grasp on them individually. Setting a counter variable up against the length, you want to set the counter at zero, since the index starts at zero. As such, javascript is ready made to count the index against the length. It would be my guess that the writers of the language purposely made the length one number greater, so we wouldn&rsquo;t have to use the &lt;= and can just set it as &lt; .length.</p>

<p>In learning javascript, it seems we are not exactly building programs from scratch as I thought entering this class. Turns out, the charAT(x) method is already programmed to give us the index number of a string. We&rsquo;re really building programs using ready made programs already inside of javascript, which makes it all too easy to increment a number in the place of x and have the computer fetch the letter of a string for us. And here I thought we were going to be building functions from scratch; yet the charAT method is actually a function itself. What we&rsquo;re really doing is using ready made functions to save us a little time and get us to deeper functions.</p>

<p>We had a fun time learning elements and principles of design:
  elements: line, shape, form, space, color, value, texture.
  principles: balance, contrast, focal point, harmony, movement, repetition, proportion, variety.
Elements are like words, and principles are like grammar. I did a fun piece using line and proportion. Was nice to take a break from the computer screen and draw!</p>

<p>Finally, we used git merge to compare our worksheet answers with the correct answers. Omg, that was some tedious work to compare the two worksheets and re-save them into one!</p>

<p>A busy week, and I am ready for some weekend R&amp;R!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The language of javascript is pretty impressive. As we moved into chapter two, we got to see variables and loops in action. Functions, parameters, and arguments have their purpose, but loops using variables was the combination of math and computer science I was waiting to see.</p>

<p>As I type, my browser is in an endless loop listening for my every move, waiting upon me alone. Thank you browser. And thank for me also your ancient patriarch, server, who is indeed my server, serving and waiting patiently upon me before you were even born.</p>

<p>I also had fun learning control flow with conditional execution. Understanding what really runs the web: for me, that’s what learning this is all about. The user has to have a satisfying experience. In order to give them that, there must be an underlying control to the constant flow of options and decisions a user will make online. A web site is a river, and we have to execute the current.</p>

<p>We capped the week off doing a Scrum exercise. Scrum is one of the software development techniques in Agile, which is a mainstream in the industry. Agile, standing for the fact that they help a company provide lightweight process frameworks for agile development of their software: low overhead, efficiency, cooperation between departments, etc. The Scrum exercise had us practicing sprints, where we sprint through the different phases of development, but in an organized, efficient, well-mannered way. Our team had a lot of fun with this exercise, and it was a good break from our computers.</p>

<p>See you next week, and Happy 4th!!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>2nd week done! We began learning javascript this week!. || &amp;&amp; ! > == PEMDAS. Comparative operators and logical operators. True and False. All important.</p>

<p>We also learned quite a bit about the industry, and its' various jobs. Front end and back end devs, dev ops, full stack devs, user interface designers, and user-experience design. I am excited to go to a UX conference that we received free tickets for in July. A particular article on &ldquo;Better User Experience with Storytelling&rdquo; caught my eye. I will have to finish reading that this weekend.</p>

<p>Telling a story is something every company has to do in one way or another, and I am very curious, even excited, to see how that translates into web development. At first glance, UX through storytelling seems to me to be a field that will continue to grow. Who knows, I could be a part of it.</p>

<p>We also did a mood board this week. I used Pinterest. My mood is good. I am calm, serene, and only finding myself more and more as I continue following this passion in web development</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Week 1 YWeb</h1>

<p>Wow, I really am excited about everything that has transpired this last week! A lot to learn, but a lot has been learned. Maybe I can do this afterall :-) Oh, future self, are you laughing reading that. Yes, you started out overwhelmed, don&rsquo;t you remember? Are you still overwhelmed? LOL, I hope not.</p>

<p>I was watching Late Night with James Corden the other night, and he made fun of Kim Kardashian&rsquo;s letter to her future self by reading a fake one of his own from ten years ago. It was a very funny bit. Who knew that the next day I would be writing a letter to my future self! My instructor said that the message after &lsquo;git commit&rsquo; is essentially a letter to my future self. I love that explanation, and then beginning to write this blog, I realized that I was re-enacting the Corden bit. Providence? Did my higher power have this all planned out? Future self, only you know the answer&hellip;&hellip;</p>
