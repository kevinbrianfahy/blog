		<p>The language of javascript is pretty impressive. As we moved into chapter two, we got to see variables and loops in action. Functions, parameters, and arguments have their purpose, but loops using variables was the combination of math and computer science I was waiting to see.</p>

<p>As I type, my browser is in an endless loop listening for my every move, waiting upon me alone. Thank you browser. And thank for me also your ancient patriarch, server, who is indeed my server, serving and waiting patiently upon me before you were even born.</p>

<p>I also had fun learning control flow with conditional execution. Understanding what really runs the web: for me, thatâ€™s what learning this is all about. The user has to have a satisfying experience. In order to give them that, there must be an underlying control to the constant flow of options and decisions a user will make online. A web site is a river, and we have to execute the current.</p>

<p>We capped the week off doing a Scrum exercise. Scrum is one of the software development techniques in Agile, which is a mainstream in the industry. Agile, standing for the fact that they help a company provide lightweight process frameworks for agile development of their software: low overhead, efficiency, cooperation between departments, etc. The Scrum exercise had us practicing sprints, where we sprint through the different phases of development, but in an organized, efficient, well-mannered way. Our team had a lot of fun with this exercise, and it was a good break from our computers.</p>

<p>See you next week, and Happy 4th!!!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>2nd week done! We began learning javascript this week!. || &amp;&amp; ! > == PEMDAS. Comparative operators and logical operators. True and False. All important.</p>

<p>We also learned quite a bit about the industry, and its' various jobs. Front end and back end devs, dev ops, full stack devs, user interface designers, and user-experience design. I am excited to go to a UX conference that we received free tickets for in July. A particular article on &ldquo;Better User Experience with Storytelling&rdquo; caught my eye. I will have to finish reading that this weekend.</p>

<p>Telling a story is something every company has to do in one way or another, and I am very curious, even excited, to see how that translates into web development. At first glance, UX through storytelling seems to me to be a field that will continue to grow. Who knows, I could be a part of it.</p>

<p>We also did a mood board this week. I used Pinterest. My mood is good. I am calm, serene, and only finding myself more and more as I continue following this passion in web development</p>

		<h1>Week 1 YWeb</h1>

<p>Wow, I really am excited about everything that has transpired this last week! A lot to learn, but a lot has been learned. Maybe I can do this afterall :-) Oh, future self, are you laughing reading that. Yes, you started out overwhelmed, don&rsquo;t you remember? Are you still overwhelmed? LOL, I hope not.</p>

<p>I was watching Late Night with James Corden the other night, and he made fun of Kim Kardashian&rsquo;s letter to her future self by reading a fake one of his own from ten years ago. It was a very funny bit. Who knew that the next day I would be writing a letter to my future self! My instructor said that the message after &lsquo;git commit&rsquo; is essentially a letter to my future self. I love that explanation, and then beginning to write this blog, I realized that I was re-enacting the Corden bit. Providence? Did my higher power have this all planned out? Future self, only you know the answer&hellip;&hellip;</p>
