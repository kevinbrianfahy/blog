We began this week with chapter four in Eloquent JavaScript, "Data Structures: Objects and Arrays," but spend most of the week doing CSS. We also did some more work on git branching, and committing. My presentation on the paradigm shift to web development went well. I'll be writing an article on that, specifically, soon.

Between CodeSchool, and two projects we worked on, we did a lot with CSS this week. The selectors exercise consisted of a grid of tiny cells, 256 total, each of which had to be individually selected to alter the page, without changing any html. I found it very fun actually! I used a lot of "nth-child()," linear gradients with varying degrees, some attribute selectors, borders, shading, etc. By the time I was done you could hardly recognize the grid I'd started with. Very proud of my work.

Zen Garden was a little simpler, and the first project we worked on, consisting of styling a pre-made Web site, again without altering the html. I made use of floats for the side bar, and a:hover for the links, changing their color when hovered over. All-in-all, a pretty nice break from the constant study of JavaScript we've become accustomed to.

I'm doing well with the deadlines, and grades thus far. Actually, we only have four weeks left! Time goes quickly when you're having fun. This is a summer I'll never forget, one where I've learned more and applied myself more than any summer ever before. Ready to start working on JavaScript objects!
