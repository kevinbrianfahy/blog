I want to take a moment in this weekly blog to give appreciation to some of the small, but valuable, things we are doing in this program. While it's great that we are learing the language of JavaScript, a good web developer program is not all about learning programming.

We have been using Trello to organize and keep track of our work assignments, due dates, and progress. The trello cards work great for this type of thing, and being able to mangage this online from anywhere is invaluable, especially for those who are working online or on their computers all day! Harvest has the same online accessibility, but it tracks our hours worked, and being able to log in from anywhere to do this is great. 

This blog itself is an invaluable method of storing thoughts, and communicating with others. I've liked blogging in the past, and was very happy to discover that it would be required as a part of this program. When I finish this blog, I will actually push it via the command line to github, so that's a third industry specific tool that a good web development program uses. (We're storing our blog posts there for now, and are going to import them later into an actual blog site).  

Finally, we've been using an abstract tool - logic problems. If you type either, "Cut the cake logic problem" or "Knights and Knaves logic problem" into google you'll see what they are. Suffice it to say that logic problems are a fantastic way to prime your brain to get ready to probelm solve! As I found out in "cut the cake," even if you know the answer you may have trouble communicating it! So logic problems are a great tool not only to prime your brain, but also your tongue! A must tool for aspiring programmers! (I'm still working on the Knight and the Knave).

Between logic problems, blogging, pushing to github, using the command line, organizing with Trello, and tracking with Harvest, I am happy our program is using industry specific tools such as these to truly prepare us for working in the industry in all facets!
