2nd week done! We began learning javascript this week!. || && ! > == PEMDAS. Comparative operators and logical operators. True and False. All important. 

We also learned quite a bit about the industry, and its' various jobs. Front end and back end devs, dev ops, full stack devs, user interface designers, and user-experience design. I am excited to go to a UX conference that we received free tickets for in July. A particular article on "Better User Experience with Storytelling" caught my eye. I will have to finish reading that this weekend. 

Telling a story is something every company has to do in one way or another, and I am very curious, even excited, to see how that translates into web development. At first glance, UX through storytelling seems to me to be a field that will continue to grow. Who knows, I could be a part of it.

We also did a mood board this week. I used Pinterest. My mood is good. I am calm, serene, and only finding myself more and more as I continue following this passion in web development
