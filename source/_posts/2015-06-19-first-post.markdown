# Week 1 YWeb

Wow, I really am excited about everything that has transpired this last week! A lot to learn, but a lot has been learned. Maybe I can do this afterall :-) Oh, future self, are you laughing reading that. Yes, you started out overwhelmed, don't you remember? Are you still overwhelmed? LOL, I hope not. 

I was watching Late Night with James Corden the other night, and he made fun of Kim Kardashian's letter to her future self by reading a fake one of his own from ten years ago. It was a very funny bit. Who knew that the next day I would be writing a letter to my future self! My instructor said that the message after 'git commit' is essentially a letter to my future self. I love that explanation, and then beginning to write this blog, I realized that I was re-enacting the Corden bit. Providence? Did my higher power have this all planned out? Future self, only you know the answer......
