There's only three weeks left!

We visited ZenDesk this week. Our class was very impressed with their layout, and they did such a great presentation of their company. First we were taken into the lounge to watch video's on what their company does, then we were given a full tour of all departments, with an explanation of the role each plays, and finally in one of their conference rooms for lunch four other employees came and let us ask questions. They gave us so much information about themselves, and why they do what they do. As a customer service software company, they are truly helping to turn around the negative stigma that surrounds corporate America anytime a customer has to get help with their product. It just goes to show there is no area that tech cannot transform and change in a positive, and profitable way. That was a fun visit.

This week we have been finishing up the content for our portfolio web site. I've had a lot of fun constructing each page. It's given us the opportunity to use some of the commands we didn't have to use in our basic projects, like moving an element around the screen with absolute position on the x and y axis. You also get a better appreciation for CSS when you have multiple pages to work on, and the value of properly constructed and organized html is very obvious too. After all is said and done, we will look back and be very proud of our work. Everything is starting to come together now, and we're even learning JQuery to manipulate DOM elements. We will have a mini-project due Wednesday for that. I'd like to alter my video on my home page somehow using JQuery.

Next will be our group project, and before you know it, we'll be graduating! This has been a very intensive learning experience, and it's nice to be able to blog so I can look back on the chronology of what, and how, we learned. I definitely plan on continuing to blog as it serves as a great memory tool to jot down what you've done, and write on how you've applied this or that element, code, etc.

I will be back to blog more on JQuery as we work on that this week!
