The language of javascript is pretty impressive. As we moved into chapter two, we got to see variables and loops in action. Functions, parameters, and arguments have their purpose, but loops using variables was the combination of math and computer science I was waiting to see.

As I type, my browser is in an endless loop listening for my every move, waiting upon me alone. Thank you browser. And thank for me also your ancient patriarch, server, who is indeed my server, serving and waiting patiently upon me before you were even born.

I also had fun learning control flow with conditional execution. Understanding what really runs the web: for me, thatâ€™s what learning this is all about. The user has to have a satisfying experience. In order to give them that, there must be an underlying control to the constant flow of options and decisions a user will make online. A web site is a river, and we have to execute the current.

We capped the week off doing a Scrum exercise. Scrum is one of the software development techniques in Agile, which is a mainstream in the industry. Agile, standing for the fact that they help a company provide lightweight process frameworks for agile development of their software: low overhead, efficiency, cooperation between departments, etc. The Scrum exercise had us practicing sprints, where we sprint through the different phases of development, but in an organized, efficient, well-mannered way. Our team had a lot of fun with this exercise, and it was a good break from our computers.

See you next week, and Happy 4th!!!
