I'm presenting to the class tomorrow on "The Paradigm Shift to Web Development." Fun!!! This is my main passion, the very reason I'm interested in the web at all. It will be twenty minutes - I hope nobody is mad that it's too long! Basically, we're in the middle of an economic paradigm shift - isn't that exciting? It is to me. The premise is that on face value, the world changes, but whether a technology or industrial revolution, we're always dependent on the same patterns of networking that were established with the very first river's and canals in the old world economy.

Html skeletons for our portfolio are due tomorrow. I hope I'm not speaking out of turn, but so far it certainly seems to me that the majority of web development is CSS (aside from JavaScript of course). I was surprised to learn just how absolutely-nothing a web site is without CSS. Talk about a boring page to look at!

Were done with chapter 3 on functions. Much more I want to review again, when it comes to recursive, closure, nesting, and so on. I love it! We're getting a good overall view, and my hunger to learn only increases.

My tool set is increasing. I'm getting sharper picks and shovels on my belt, and learning how to control current! Today I leave you with this:
"The basic pattern of life is a network. Whenever you see life, you see networks. The whole planet, what we can term 'Gaia' is a network of processes involving feedback tubes. Humans are part of the larger whole, Gaia."
