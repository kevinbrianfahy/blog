  <div class="entry-content"><p>My last post touched on the difference between core JavaScript and Web API&rsquo;s, or client-side JavaScript. Because of the importance of this difference, I felt one more blog post was in order on the topic. Again, I highly encourage you to read the article at <a target='_blank' href='http://foorious.com/ikn/javascript/r2j/what-is-javascript/'>foorious.com</a> which does a great job of explaining the difference between core JavaScript and Web API&rsquo;s. The main Web API that core JavaScript deals with is the Document object, or DOM, standing for Document Object Model.</p>

<p>The following are all quotes from <a target='_blank' href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction'>MDN, “Introduction to the DOM”</a>, including the script examples:
“The DOM provides a representation of the document as a structured group of nodes and objects that have properties and methods. Essentially, it connects web pages to scripts or programming languages&hellip;..The DOM is a fully object-oriented representation of the web page, and it can be modified with a scripting language&hellip;.All of the properties, methods, and events available for manipulating and creating web pages are organized into objects&hellip;.The DOM is not a programming language, but without it, (languages) wouldn&rsquo;t have any model or notion of the web pages, XML pages and elements with which (they are) usually concerned&hellip;”</p>

<p style='margin:0'>“Implementations of the DOM can be built for any language....The DOM was designed to be independent of any particular programming language...
Python DOM example to return a list all &lt;p> elements in the document:
<pre style='margin:0 0 0 10%;padding:0 0 0 5%; color:purple; background: #B2B2B2; font-weight: bold;'>
import xml.dom.minidom as m
doc = m.parse('C:\\Projects\\Py\\chap1.xml');
doc.nodeName # DOM property of document object;
p_list = doc.getElementsByTagName('para');
</pre>JavaScript DOM example to return a list of all &lt;p> elements in the document:
<pre style='margin:0 0 0 10%;padding:0 0 0 5%; color:purple; background: #B2B2B2; font-weight: bold;'>
var paragraphs = document.getElementsByTagName('P');
// paragraphs[0] is the first &lt;p> element
// paragraphs[1] is the second &lt;p> element, etc.
alert(paragraphs[0].nodeName)
</pre></p>


<p>&ldquo;&hellip;documents may be accessed by various browsers with different DOMs&hellip;.Different browsers have different implementations of the DOM, and these implementations exhibit varying degrees of conformance&hellip; but every web browser uses some document object model to make web pages accessible to script&hellip;.In the beginning, JavaScript and the DOM were tightly intertwined, but eventually they evolved into separate entities&hellip;.”</p>

<p>MDN further expounds on the fact that there are different DOM&rsquo;s in <a target='_blank' href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/JavaScript_technologies_overview'>JavaScript Technologies Overview”</a>:
“As every web developer has experienced, the DOM is a mess. Browser support uniformity varies a lot from feature to feature, mainly because many important DOM features have very unclear, specifications (if any), and different web browsers add incompatible features for overlapping use cases (like the Internet Explorer event model)&hellip;.One common, though perhaps not the most reliable, approach to cross-browser compatibility is to use JavaScript libraries, which abstract DOM features and keep their APIs working the same in different browsers. Some of the most widely used frameworks are jQuery, prototype, and YUI&hellip;..”</p>

<p>Understanding that it is a language independent convention, and that it is a totally different DOM in each browser are the two main take-aways. When I looked up other <a target='_blank' href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API'>Web API&rsquo;s on Mozilla</a>, I was pleased to read “interfaces (that is, types of objects)” on the very first line! According to Mozilla, we can officially call Web API&rsquo;s types of objects. If you look at that list of Web API&rsquo;s on the link – wow! The browser is a very powerful piece of software! In front-end web development, it is better to think of the purpose of your code as communicating with the types of objects in the browser, which will be different from browser to browser.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Our bootcamp got to the point of understanding objects. Starting at ground zero, we learned operators, variables, conditionals, functions, and left off on objects. I could immediately see the importance of an object in programming. I mean, you can store anything in there, and save it all to one single object! I&rsquo;m not sure if it was on purpose to get us right up to learning objects, but it proves to be a good place to end an intensive crash course, because once you understand objects, you can spread your wings and fly into the wide world of object-oriented programming, which is especially central in web development, and much of programming altogether.</p>

<p>To help in my continued learning, I purchased &ldquo;JavaScript, the Definitive Guide, 6th Edition&rdquo; by David Flanagan, published by O'Reilly Media. It&rsquo;s a fantastic book. To be honest, I much prefer it to the book we used in my bootcamp, because it addresses the issue of object-oriented programming upfront. &ldquo;JavaScript is an object-oriented language, but it is quite different than most&rdquo; p. 8. That immediately cleared up confusion some of us had in class as to whether or not JavaScript was officially an object-oriented language. &ldquo;JavaScripts fundamental datatype is the object&hellip;.JavaScript objects are dynamic - properties can usually be added and deleted - but they can be used to simulate the static objects and &lsquo;structs&rsquo; of statically typed languages&hellip;.and are manipulated by reference rather than by value&rdquo; (p 115). As a matter of fact, I was surprised to learn the function is actually an object type! (p 30) In JavaScript, ANYTHING that is not a number, string, boolean, null, or undefined is an object type. (p 29) This allows functions to be passed, manipulated, have properties set to them, invoke methods on them, just as objects. (p 163)</p>

<p>Then there was the confusion I had about the environment. I didn&rsquo;t understand why we always had to use console.log in JSFiddle to check our work. Studying on my own since graduation, I was surprised to learn that core JavaScript actually has no input or output capability. &ldquo;Unlike most programming languages, the JavaScript language has no concept of input or output. It is designed to run as a scripting language in a host environment, and it is up to the host environment to provide mechanisms for communicating with the outside world.&rdquo; (<a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript' target='_blank'>MDN, 4th para</a>). While it is written as a complete language, it was written to interact with HTML, so it was never written with its own environment, but instead depends on the enviroment set up by the browser. JavaScript communicates with the browser through a browser API that translates the HTML into object form. The HTML object created by the browser API is called the Window object, and it is actually a host object to core JavaScript. The Window object is not technically JavaScript, as evidenced by the fact that you can turn JavaScript off in a web browser and web pages still load. The Window object becomes JavaScript, so to speak, when the web page html is loaded into the browser window, and there is also JavaScript code to interpret. The Window object becomes the host global enviroment for JavaScript. Remember &ldquo;this&rdquo; from my last post? Well &ldquo;Window&rdquo; replaces &ldquo;this&rdquo; in JavaScript once a web page is loaded into the browser window. After all, it&rsquo;s HTML that communicates to the user by displaying things in the browser window. The HTML is always the final ouput/input for a user, and thus the &ldquo;HTML object&rdquo; is the global, or top-level enviroment.</p>

<p>So how does this Window object, API, work? &ldquo;Document Elements As Window Properties - If you name an element in your HTML document using the id attribute&hellip;the Window object is given a nonenumerable property whose name is the value of the id attribute and whose value is the HTML Element object that represents that document element. As we&rsquo;ve already noted, the Window object serves as the global object at the top of the scope chain in client-side JavaScript, so this means that the id attributes you use in your HTML documents become global variables accessible to your scripts&hellip;..Any HTML element with an id attribute will become the value of a global variable, assuming the ID is not already used by the Window object.&rdquo; (p 351, 352) This is fairly fascinating because you don&rsquo;t have to actually use &ldquo;document.getElementById.&rdquo; You can simply type in the id of the element you want to write code for, and the id is automatcally recognized because the id is ALREADY a global variable! Still, this is very bad practice, as you are messing with global variables. Since toying with global variables in never a good practice, the document object within the window object was created for the purpose of manipulating html elements.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Window object is the main entry point to all client-side JavaScript features and API&rsquo;s. It represents a web browser window or frame, and you can refer to it with the identifier &lsquo;window&rsquo;&hellip;One of the most important properties of the Window object is document: it refers to a Document object that represents the content displayed in the window. The Document object has important methods such as getElementById(), which returns a single document element&hellip;..the element object returned by getElementById() has other important properties and methods that allow scripts to get is content, set the value of its attributes, and so on:&rdquo; (pp 307, 308). The document object allows us to manipulate what is being displayed on the screen as much as we want to without ever altering the source code the window object initially retrieves from the URL. That&rsquo;s one of the beauties of objects within objects!</p>

<p>All of the methods in the Document object to target html elements are not technically a part of JavaScript, but a part of the host environment. They are all a part of the Document object in the browser API. The event listeners are also a part of both the Window and Document objects. They can attach listeners to specific properties in the objects.</p>

<p>Core JavaScript has the ability to simulate static without really being static by making everything an object, while at the same time making objects mutable by reference alone. This quality makes it easy to see why JavaScript is a language more suited for the flexibility of interaction with the user than other languages, even though these characteristics can certainly cause confusion. Add to this that all input and output is not even handled by core JavaScript, that the methods to target the html elements, and listen to events, are not JavaScript, and it&rsquo;s ALSO easy to see why JavaScript is the world&rsquo;s most misunderstood language, often seen merely as a scripting tool, and not given respect as a real language. (See <a href='http://www.crockford.com/javascript/javascript.html' target='_blank'>Here</a>). After all, its the web API that&rsquo;s doing the real work, translating the html into object form, listening, getting input, and sending output, not JavaScript. Technically, these methods could be used by other languages. Since JavaScript is the language of choice for the internet, these Document and Window methods are referred to as client-side JavaScript, the host environment provided by the browser&rsquo;s API.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see a fiddle that puts all of my learning in action:</p>

<p><a href='http://jsfiddle.net/kevinbrianfahy/8115ztf3/3/' target='_blank'>My Fiddle</a></p>

<p>The above fiddle I created gives an example of how JavaScript can obtain input/output through the browser host environment. Turns out, retrieving info entered in the input tag is very easy, as the API in the browser does all the work for you. I did nothing. It&rsquo;s standard object notation to get at the values the Document object holds. As soon as I enter an input tag and give it an id, that id becomes a property in the Window, and Document objects. The method of the Document Object, &ldquo;getElementById()&rdquo; allows me even easier access, as far as object notation. For the input object returned by that method, it has a property, &ldquo;value&rdquo;, with a value that changes depending on what the user types in.</p>

<p>In my fiddle, I only had to use core JavaScript to loop through an array I created of colors that used the &ldquo;dark&rdquo; prefix (for the outline color), and an if/else conditional to display different messages depending on the color the user typed in. The rest was actually methods of the Document object. I used the Document object methods to select the input element, and to listen anytime the user changed the value of that element; yet, it helped to use JavaScript because it allowed the Document object to be manipulated by reference alone. All I had to do was point a variable to an object property, and anytime the variable changed, the Document object changed with it. <code>var newcolor = document.getElementById('choose').value; document.body.style.background = newcolor;</code> Hopefully this helps for anybody looking to grasp the nuances of JavaScript in use, its benefits, and it&rsquo;s very different input/output mechanism through a host enviroment.</p>

<p>Certainly, the concept of windows in a computer is nothing new, yet the fiddle I created demonstrates the user ability to change the window contents depending on their preference, i.e. the window with the browser Window object combined with JavaScript is dynamic. Windows are not usually dynamic; you cannot change what displays in a window. Even if you decide to bring up a different file in your desktop window, all the window can do is display from files that already exist. This is different. It allows the user to load into the window a non-existing file that is literally created as the user types it.</p>

<p>For a fantastic article about the difference between JavaScript core and Web API&rsquo;s referred to as client-side JavaScript, see <a href="http://foorious.com/ikn/javascript/r2j/what-is-javascript/.">http://foorious.com/ikn/javascript/r2j/what-is-javascript/.</a> In the industry, many people will refer to these Web API&rsquo;s as JavaScript. Most won&rsquo;t even say client-side JavaScript. This is very mis-leading for a beginner. It is extremely important for a beginner to understand that Web API&rsquo;s are in fact not JavaScript.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My first post-class blog is on the gallery page I made for my portfolio website, which was one of our end-of-class final projects. We wanted a page to show the projects we&rsquo;d worked on in class, and demonstrate the things we&rsquo;d learned so far. As a total newbie in programming, I was very proud with what I came up with for my gallery page. Start simple: show a small picture of each project, have a description for each image, and make each image link to the actual project. Use a &lsquo;ul&rsquo; and have each &lsquo;li&rsquo; contain an &lsquo;a&rsquo; with an &lsquo;img&rsquo; inside the &lsquo;a&rsquo;. Great, but beginner or not, I couldn&rsquo;t leave the page this simple! We&rsquo;d learned some Jquery, so I figured out how to have css hide each description and use Jquery to have each description slide onto the page when it&rsquo;s corresponding image was hovered over. While I was at it, I used the css pseudo-class &lsquo;:hover&rsquo; with the &lsquo;img&rsquo; selector, <code>img:hover</code>, and <code>{transform: scale(1.5), transition: .75s}</code> to have each image get larger in view while it was being hovered over, and while the description was sliding in from the bottom.</p>

<p style='margin:0'>
Often in programming, the valuable lessons are not in learning how to get the computer to do something. That's just a matter of memorizing commands and letting the magic work: copy-and-paste magic, if you will. It's just 'mouseenter','mouseleave', 'show', and 'animate': 
<pre style='margin:0 0 0 10%;padding:0 0 0 5%; color:purple; background: #B2B2B2; font-weight: bold;'>
$('#id of image').on({mouseenter: function() { 
  $('#id of description').show().animate({'right': '10%'}, 1500);
  },
  mouseleave: function() {
  $('#id of description').animate({'right': '-100%'});
  }
});
</pre>
</p>


<p style='margin:default'>
One valuable lesson, maybe the first for a beginner, is using your knowledge of programming to clean your code. Clean code does not repeat itself, and we use the acronym DRY, for Don't Repeat Yourself. Can you imagine how horrible it would be to read a book by an author who constantly repeats himself over and over? Take the above code, for example. I have to repeat that entire code for every single image and description in my gallery. That's just bad programming. There should be a way to write the code so that it performs this function for every image the user hovers over, without having to re-write it each time. 
</p>


<p style='margin:default'>
We start with the first line, and change '#id of image' to it's parent, 'ul img.' <code>$('ul img').on({mouseenter: function() {</code> That should activate the mouseenter function for every li image hovered over in the ul. Jquery's "$('ul img')" takes all the image tags in the ul and puts them in an array. It is the same as JavaScripts's "document.querySelectorAll('ul img')". 
</p>


<p style='margin:0'>
For the next step, usually, you would think of if/else conditionals in such situations, since we often use conditionals when looping over arrays: if the mouse hovers over $('ul img')[0], then show the description that matches, if the mouse hovers over $('ul img')[1], then show the matching description. What would your if-conditional statement be? If ul img == ul img[0]?? That doesn't work. The array will never be equal to an element inside of it. Remember, in JavaScript, an array is an object. "When a function is called as a method of an object, its 'this' is set to the object the method is called on." (<a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this' target='_blank'>MDN</a>). The first part of this statement - "When a function is called as a method of an object," - is exactly what's happening when you code "$('ul img').on()". "$('ul img')" is a JavaScript object. (You need to understand the DOM API to understand why html tags are JavaScript objects.) If you recall, methods are object properties whose value is a function. ".on()" is a method of the "$('ul img')" object. When you are using the mouseenter function on several li items, 'this' will tell the program to focus only on the li being hovered over by the mouse. Now my code can look like:
<pre style='margin:0 0 0 10%;padding:0 0 0 5%; color:purple; background: #B2B2B2; font-weight: bold;'>
$('#id-of-ul img').on({mouseenter: function() {
    if (this == $('#projects img')[0])
        $('#id of description').show().animate({'right': '10%'}, 1500);
    if (this == $('#projects img')[1])
        $('#id of description').show().animate({'right': '10%'}, 1500);
    if (this == $('#projects img')[2])
        $('#id of description').show().animate({'right': '10%'}, 1500);
    }
});
</pre>
</p>


<p style='margin:0'>
 The obvious problem is that writing a conditional for every situation doesn't help us shrink our code anymore than if we just re-wrote the function for each item, as we did in the beginning. If I'm not re-writing code for each li item, and I'm not using if/else conditionals for the same reason (DRY), then how do I code which description div to show when the mouse hovers over the image? This is a perfect example problem for a beginner on proper use of html attributes for coding purposes, taking their programming skill out of the copy-and-paste magic into their first bit of original programming. The id attribute in html 5 was essentially created for Javascript, and was meant to be retrieved by Javascript for the very purpose of selecting elements. The class attribute should be used for css, but certainly can be used in Javascript if necessary. You'll notice the id atttributes of the image and it's corresponding description are almost exactly the same, obviously, because the one is for the other. Essentially, the id for the description that you need to show is already contained in the id attribute for the image. The difference can be as small as a dash, '-'. So as long as we retrieve our id attribute value from the li and store it in a variable, simple string concatenation gets us our id for the description by adding a '-d' to the variable. Now we have a variable that changes depending on what is being hovered over, and we can write our code like this:
 <pre style='margin:0 0 0 10%;padding:0 0 0 5%; color:purple; background: #B2B2B2; font-weight: bold;'>
$('#id-of-ul img').on({mouseenter: function() { 
    var description = $(this).attr('id') + '-d';
    $('#' + description).show().animate({'right': '10%'}, 1500);
    },
    mouseleave: function() {
    var description = $(this).attr('id') + '-d';
    $('#' + description).animate({'right': '-100%'});
    }
});
</pre>
Finally, we are DRY! You'll notice there is one last line of duplication, "var description: = $(this).attr('id') + '-d'." This is still DRY code even with that duplication, because there is no way around it. Unfortunately, because the value of the variable "description" is "$(this)", you cannot save the variable in the global environment. If you try, the value of the variable simply comes back undefined. I do hate having to write that line twice, but it is succinct nonetheless. 
</p>


<p style='margin:default'>
"This", coupled with the "attr()" method, prevents us from having to specify each li tag, either by writing a mouseenter function for each one, "$('#id of image')", or using if/else conditionals with "$('ul img')[0]", "$('ul img')[1]", and "$('ul img')[2]." They make our code DRY. They also allow us to write a dynamically altered code, i.e. we dont' have to add to the code everytime we change or add to our list of images and descriptions. 
</p>


<p><p style='margin:0'>
p.s. here is the code using pure JavaScript (without animation):
<pre style='margin:0 0 0 10%;padding:0 0 0 5%; color:purple; background: #B2B2B2; font-weight: bold;'>
var projects = document.querySelectorAll(&lsquo;#projects img&rsquo;);
    for (var i=0; i &lt; projects.length; i++) {
        projects[i].addEventListener(&lsquo;mouseenter&rsquo;, function() {
        var description = this.id + &lsquo;-d&rsquo;;
        document.getElementById(description).style.display = &lsquo;block&rsquo;;
        })
        projects[i].addEventListener(&lsquo;mouseleave&rsquo;, function() {
        var description = this.id + &lsquo;-d&rsquo;;
        document.getElementById(description).style.display = &lsquo;none&rsquo;;
        })
    }
</pre>
</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wow. Officially done. Graduated. Seems strange to say, even to think about how much we covered in such a short time. Prior to this class, I literally knew nothing about computer programming, and now I&rsquo;ve built my own portfolio website, and started an open source project on github. Amazing.</p>

<p>I will be placed in an internship with a tech company, and by all means I want employment, but at the same time I want to be involved in the industry as a whole. There is so much changing in tech, and changing so fast, it is doubtful I can learn all I want to with only one company. For this reason, I look forward to staying networked with YwebCA. Adorable.io, and YWCA have partnered to create something never done before, and I am very curious to see how far it can go, and where it will lead for all involved. I&rsquo;ve been proud to be a part of it. The graduation was awesome. We even had a Madison Alderperson attend, as the keynote speaker.</p>

<p>YwebCA is different. They feel strongly about their students beginning blogs, despite knowing nothing. We began our blogs immediately in week one. Blogs being so important to aspiring developers, the thought of the YwebCA is to immediately install the important habit of organizing your learning and knowledge into translatable words on a page.  Indeed, many who become great programmers find it almost too late to develop this habit. They become the stereotypical isolated programmer, and find they have to go back and re-learn how to communicate. This wastes valuable time and many possible job opportunities if they already had a blog up and running, and had for years practiced the valuable habit of translating their learning into a blog.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve taken to this naturally, as I already liked to write, and I have the small hope that my blogs can yet be beneficial for future students. There may even be a market for such a beginner blog, as many who want to get into programming try to learn online and find themselves overwhelmed and unable to self-learn. For all of these reasons, I am excited to continue my blog, and hope you enjoy reading!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I can&rsquo;t believe this is already the last week (coming up). Time flies.</p>

<p>We learned some Ruby on Rails this week. Quick notes:
  MVC model
  The Controller handles the decisions, the Model handles the data, and the View handles the presentation. We should follow this architecture and keep our code in the right places. Decision code should go in the controller, data code goes in the model, and presentation code goes in the view. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTdVkgF_Slo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTdVkgF_Slo</a>
Our class hosted a workshop that took place the day before the Ruby conference here in Madison, WI, and we made a tiny web app that is live at <a href="https://tranquil-journey-6408.herokuapp.com/.">https://tranquil-journey-6408.herokuapp.com/.</a> It was great fun to learn some basic back end!</p>

<p>This next week is all about completing the class capstone, our group project. I was elected team captain by a vote from the class! We all agreed on a rather unique web site to develop. The goal is to create an open source project that helps spanish speaking people understand the etymology behind computer language tags. Seeing as all programming languages are written in English, and coding can often use idioms, it&rsquo;s fascinating to think that even experienced programmers, if from another country, may have no idea why certain tags use the letters they use. Example - the &lt;a> for &lsquo;anchor&rsquo; tag. Clearly the use of the word, &lsquo;anchor,&rsquo; is an idiom. One who doesn&rsquo;t speak English gains very little understanding of why we use the letter &lsquo;a&rsquo; for links simply by reading a dictionary definition of the word &lsquo;anchor.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s truly a unique project, and it will be fun to see if we can truly grow it into a contributed open source work in real life. We&rsquo;ve decided to start with only HTML terminology, but the possibilities are endless.</p>

<p>We also began to style our Octopress blogs. If I didn&rsquo;t mention in last week&rsquo;s blog, we imported all our saved blog posts into Octopress and now have our own live blogs! By tomorrow we are supposed to style the blog to fit in with our portfolio style, so today I downloaded and installed a theme from github, and am working on styling it as I type this. I must be growing to have installed from the command line without being intimidated. I definitely ran into some kinks along the way too. I had to delete the ruby gemfile and re-install my gems, so I&rsquo;m even getting better at troubleshooting by researching online, although in the end a classmate who had the same issue helped me. The important thing is that I actually understand what&rsquo;s going on under the hood now with a lot of these things. The command line, github, using ruby, things aren&rsquo;t as foreign to me now.</p>

<p>I really feel that I have learned a lot over these last ten weeks and am beginning to build upon a foundation. YWebCA has been great for me, and it will be sad to leave. Our graduation is six days away! This will be a busy last week not only getting our group project finished, but also putting the finishing touches on our individual portfolio&rsquo;s that we&rsquo;ve been working on for several weeks now, here and there, inbetween all our other assignments. I promise to keep blogging even after we graduate. There will be a week 11!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We had a great time with jQuery!! I learned how to hide elements in my html that I can later show with jQuery. And not just that, but I can animate those elements when I decide to show them. Sorry, CSS selectors, I now have a new most-fun project. The more fun, the longer it takes, as this project definitely took longer than arranging selectors with triple gradients and 45 degree angles. By the time I was done with this project, I was using pure JavaScript in addition to jQuery.</p>

<p>I had the idea to try and get people interested in watching the video on my home page, rather than just clicking the navigation links at the top of the page right away (our capstone project is to build our own portfolio website). After some tedious cropping away at an image of a stage with red curtains, I attempted to have curtains slowly move in from the side of the screen when someone simply put the mouse over the video. That in itself was extraordinary fun, but the real surprise to me was how the project kept evolving. That&rsquo;s what I love about learning programming, once you have an idea, you can constantly improve upon that idea to truly make something fun, interactive, and special to both user and creator.</p>

<p>I also knew I could create a class in CSS to make the background black, like a theatre, and then add that class in jQuery. I added a drape, above the video, dropping in from the top, and delayed the curtains from the side. It wasn&rsquo;t until then that I decided to do some research on my own, going beyond our class curriculum, and look up what could be done to initiate the effect on video play, not just mouseover. Turns out there is an event handler for the video element in html 5 that will allow not only to initiate the jQuery sequence at video play, but also allow it to cease at video end! This was perfect! I could have the curtains pull back immediately when the video ended.</p>

<p>And you know what? In the process I even learned how to create my own play and stop buttons using pure JavaScript! Although jQuery had an event handler for playing, it does not make use of the .play() method used to create the play button. By the time I was finished, I had learned the workaround for this (to pull a native DOM element) in jQuery using .get(0), and the JavaScript alternative of document.getElementById(). Needless to say, I am very happy with this last week&rsquo;s project. :-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&rsquo;s only three weeks left!</p>

<p>We visited ZenDesk this week. Our class was very impressed with their layout, and they did such a great presentation of their company. First we were taken into the lounge to watch video&rsquo;s on what their company does, then we were given a full tour of all departments, with an explanation of the role each plays, and finally in one of their conference rooms for lunch four other employees came and let us ask questions. They gave us so much information about themselves, and why they do what they do. As a customer service software company, they are truly helping to turn around the negative stigma that surrounds corporate America anytime a customer has to get help with their product. It just goes to show there is no area that tech cannot transform and change in a positive, and profitable way. That was a fun visit.</p>

<p>This week we have been finishing up the content for our portfolio web site. I&rsquo;ve had a lot of fun constructing each page. It&rsquo;s given us the opportunity to use some of the commands we didn&rsquo;t have to use in our basic projects, like moving an element around the screen with absolute position on the x and y axis. You also get a better appreciation for CSS when you have multiple pages to work on, and the value of properly constructed and organized html is very obvious too. After all is said and done, we will look back and be very proud of our work. Everything is starting to come together now, and we&rsquo;re even learning JQuery to manipulate DOM elements. We will have a mini-project due Wednesday for that. I&rsquo;d like to alter my video on my home page somehow using JQuery.</p>

<p>Next will be our group project, and before you know it, we&rsquo;ll be graduating! This has been a very intensive learning experience, and it&rsquo;s nice to be able to blog so I can look back on the chronology of what, and how, we learned. I definitely plan on continuing to blog as it serves as a great memory tool to jot down what you&rsquo;ve done, and write on how you&rsquo;ve applied this or that element, code, etc.</p>

<p>I will be back to blog more on JQuery as we work on that this week!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We began this week with chapter four in Eloquent JavaScript, &ldquo;Data Structures: Objects and Arrays,&rdquo; but spend most of the week doing CSS. We also did some more work on git branching, and committing. My presentation on the paradigm shift to web development went well. I&rsquo;ll be writing an article on that, specifically, soon.</p>

<p>Between CodeSchool, and two projects we worked on, we did a lot with CSS this week. The selectors exercise consisted of a grid of tiny cells, 256 total, each of which had to be individually selected to alter the page, without changing any html. I found it very fun actually! I used a lot of &ldquo;nth-child(),&rdquo; linear gradients with varying degrees, some attribute selectors, borders, shading, etc. By the time I was done you could hardly recognize the grid I&rsquo;d started with. Very proud of my work.</p>

<p>Zen Garden was a little simpler, and the first project we worked on, consisting of styling a pre-made Web site, again without altering the html. I made use of floats for the side bar, and a:hover for the links, changing their color when hovered over. All-in-all, a pretty nice break from the constant study of JavaScript we&rsquo;ve become accustomed to.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m doing well with the deadlines, and grades thus far. Actually, we only have four weeks left! Time goes quickly when you&rsquo;re having fun. This is a summer I&rsquo;ll never forget, one where I&rsquo;ve learned more and applied myself more than any summer ever before. Ready to start working on JavaScript objects!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m presenting to the class tomorrow on &ldquo;The Paradigm Shift to Web Development.&rdquo; Fun!!! This is my main passion, the very reason I&rsquo;m interested in the web at all. It will be twenty minutes - I hope nobody is mad that it&rsquo;s too long! Basically, we&rsquo;re in the middle of an economic paradigm shift - isn&rsquo;t that exciting? It is to me. The premise is that on face value, the world changes, but whether a technology or industrial revolution, we&rsquo;re always dependent on the same patterns of networking that were established with the very first river&rsquo;s and canals in the old world economy.</p>

<p>Html skeletons for our portfolio are due tomorrow. I hope I&rsquo;m not speaking out of turn, but so far it certainly seems to me that the majority of web development is CSS (aside from JavaScript of course). I was surprised to learn just how absolutely-nothing a web site is without CSS. Talk about a boring page to look at!</p>

<p>Were done with chapter 3 on functions. Much more I want to review again, when it comes to recursive, closure, nesting, and so on. I love it! We&rsquo;re getting a good overall view, and my hunger to learn only increases.</p>

<p>My tool set is increasing. I&rsquo;m getting sharper picks and shovels on my belt, and learning how to control current! Today I leave you with this:
&ldquo;The basic pattern of life is a network. Whenever you see life, you see networks. The whole planet, what we can term &lsquo;Gaia&rsquo; is a network of processes involving feedback tubes. Humans are part of the larger whole, Gaia.&rdquo;

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I want to take a moment in this weekly blog to give appreciation to some of the small, but valuable, things we are doing in this program. While it&rsquo;s great that we are learing the language of JavaScript, a good web developer program is not all about learning programming.</p>

<p>We have been using Trello to organize and keep track of our work assignments, due dates, and progress. The trello cards work great for this type of thing, and being able to mangage this online from anywhere is invaluable, especially for those who are working online or on their computers all day! Harvest has the same online accessibility, but it tracks our hours worked, and being able to log in from anywhere to do this is great.</p>

<p>This blog itself is an invaluable method of storing thoughts, and communicating with others. I&rsquo;ve liked blogging in the past, and was very happy to discover that it would be required as a part of this program. When I finish this blog, I will actually push it via the command line to github, so that&rsquo;s a third industry specific tool that a good web development program uses. (We&rsquo;re storing our blog posts there for now, and are going to import them later into an actual blog site).</p>

<p>Finally, we&rsquo;ve been using an abstract tool - logic problems. If you type either, &ldquo;Cut the cake logic problem&rdquo; or &ldquo;Knights and Knaves logic problem&rdquo; into google you&rsquo;ll see what they are. Suffice it to say that logic problems are a fantastic way to prime your brain to get ready to probelm solve! As I found out in &ldquo;cut the cake,&rdquo; even if you know the answer you may have trouble communicating it! So logic problems are a great tool not only to prime your brain, but also your tongue! A must tool for aspiring programmers! (I&rsquo;m still working on the Knight and the Knave).</p>

<p>Between logic problems, blogging, pushing to github, using the command line, organizing with Trello, and tracking with Harvest, I am happy our program is using industry specific tools such as these to truly prepare us for working in the industry in all facets!</p>
